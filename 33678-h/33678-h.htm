            <font size="+3">T</font>HE Catholic Church in the
            celebration of Mass and in the administration of the
            sacraments employs certain forms and rites. These are
            called ceremonies. By these ceremonies the Church
            wishes to appeal to the heart as well as to the
            intellect, and to impress the faithful with sentiments
            of faith and piety.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is more capable of raising the heart and mind of
            man to God than a priest celebrating Mass? What more
            inspiring than some of our sacred music?
        </p>
        <p>
            How beneficial and how lasting the impression formed by
            the ceremonies of the Church, the following incident
            will show:
        </p>
        <p>
            One of our missionaries once went to visit a tribe of
            Indians who had been deprived of a priest for nearly
            half a century. After traveling through the forest for
            some days he came near their village.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Twas Sunday morning. Suddenly the silence was broken
            by a number of voices singing in unison. He stopped to
            listen. To his great astonishment he distinguished the
            music of a Mass, and of Catholic hymns well known to
            him.
        </p>
        <p>
            What could be more touching than this simple, savage
            people endeavoring to celebrate the Lord's Day as they
            had been taught by the priest fifty years before? What
            more elevating than those sacred songs&mdash;the
            <i>Stabat Mater</i>, the <i>O Salutaris</i>, or the
            <i>Te Deum</i>&mdash;uttered by pious lips and
            resounding through the forest primeval? What better
            evidence could we have of the beneficial effects of our
            ceremonies in raising the heart to God?
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet few things connected with our holy religion
            have been more frequently subjected to ridicule than
            her ceremonies. People scoff at them, laugh at them,
            call them foolish and unreasonable. Those people do not
            stop to consider that by doing so they, themselves, are
            acting most unreasonably. For no reasonable person, no
            judge, will condemn another without hearing both sides
            of the question.
        </p>
        <p>
            These wiseacres, however, flatter themselves that they
            know all about the Catholic Church and her ceremonies
            without hearing her side of the case. Hence the
            misunderstandings and misrepresentations regarding her
            that exist among well-meaning people.
        </p>
        <p>
            If people would but learn to speak about that which
            they knew and understood; if they would accord to the
            Catholic Church the same treatment as to other
            institutions; if they would examine both sides of the
            question before criticising and ridiculing her
            teachings and her ceremonies; if they would but treat
            her with that openness, that fairness, that candor,
            that honesty characteristic of the American citizen
            when dealing with other questions&mdash;what a vast
            amount of ignorance, of prejudice, of sin would be
            avoided!
        </p>
        <p>
            We claim that ceremonies used in the worship of God are
            reasonable, because they were sanctioned by God in the
            Old Testament and by Jesus Christ and His apostles in
            the New Law.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a name="ceremony_1" id="ceremony_1">I.</a> Ceremonies
            Necessary to Divine Worship
        </h2>
        <p>
            <font size="+3">T</font>HE angels are pure spirits.
            They have no body. Consequently the worship they render
            God is spiritual, interior.
        </p>
        <p>
            The heavenly bodies are not spiritual, but entirely
            material substances. They render God a sort of external
            worship according to the words of the prophet Daniel,
            "Sun and moon bless the Lord, . . . stars of heaven
            bless the Lord. Praise and exalt Him forever." Man has
            a soul, a spiritual substance similar to the heavenly
            bodies. He should, therefore, honor God by the twofold
            form of worship, interior and exterior.
        </p>
        <p>
            "God is a spirit; and they that adore Him must adore
            Him in spirit and in truth" (<i>John</i> iv. 24).
        </p>
        <p>
            From these words of the beloved disciple we are not to
            conclude that interior worship is prescribed as the
            only essential, and exterior worship condemned. True
            piety must manifest itself externally. Man naturally
            manifests his feelings by outward signs and ceremonies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Catholic Church recognizes that man has a heart to
            be moved as well as an intellect to be enlightened. She
            enlightens the intellect by her good books, sermons,
            etc.; and she moves the heart by the grandeur of her
            ceremonies.
        </p>
        <p>
            If any one doubts that God considers ceremonies
            necessary to divine worship, let him read the books of
            Leviticus and Exodus. Almost the whole of these books
            treats of the rites and ceremonies used by the then
            chosen people of God in their public worship.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 26th, 27th, and 28th chapters of Exodus prescribe
            the form of the tabernacle and its appurtenances, the
            size of the altar and the oil for the lamps, and the
            holy vestments which Aaron and his sons were to wear
            during the performance of the public ceremonies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The book of Leviticus treats more particularly of the
            sacrifices, rites, and ceremonies of the priests and
            Levites.
        </p>
        <p>
            "And the Lord called Moses, and spoke to him from the
            tabernacle of the testimony, saying: Speak to the
            children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man
            among you that shall offer to the Lord a sacrifice of
            the cattle, that is, offering victims of oxen and
            sheep, if his offering be a holocaust and of the herd,
            he shall offer a male, without blemish, at the door of
            the tabernacle of the testimony, to make the Lord
            favorable to him. And he shall put his hand upon the
            head of the victim, and it shall be acceptable and help
            to his expiation" (<i>Lev.</i> i. 1 <i>et seq.</i>).
        </p>
        <p>
            After enumerating all the sacrifices and ceremonies,
            the sacred writer closes the book of Leviticus with the
            words, "These are the precepts which the Lord commanded
            Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai," thus
            showing that He considers ceremonies necessary to
            divine worship.
        </p>
        <p>
            The religion instituted by Our Lord and Saviour Jesus
            Christ is more spiritual than that of the Old Law.
            Nevertheless He did not discard ceremonies. In the
            Garden of Gethsemani He fell upon His knees in humble
            supplication. He went in procession to Jerusalem
            preceded by a great multitude strewing palm-branches on
            the road and singing, "Hosanna to the Son of David."
            Before He cured the deaf and dumb man, He put His
            fingers into his ears and touched his tongue with
            spittle, and looking up to heaven He groaned and said,
            "Ephpheta," which is, "Be thou opened."
        </p>
        <p>
            At the Last Supper He invoked a blessing on the bread
            and wine, and after the supper He chanted a hymn with
            His disciples&mdash;ceremonies similar to those used in
            the Mass. When He imparted the Holy Ghost to His
            apostles, He breathed upon them. In a similar way they
            and their successors communicated the Holy Ghost upon
            others by breathing upon them, laying their hands upon
            them and praying over them, when conferring the
            sacrament of Holy Orders.
        </p>
        <p>
            St. James directs that if any man is sick he shall call
            in a priest of the Church, who shall anoint him with
            oil, as is done in the sacrament of Extreme Unction.
        </p>
        <p>
            We must, therefore, admit that ceremonies used in the
            worship of God are reasonable, since they are
            sanctioned by God in the Old Law and by Jesus Christ
            and His apostles in the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
            All these acts of Our Saviour&mdash;the prostration in
            the Garden, the procession to Jerusalem, the touching
            of the deaf man's ears, the chanting of the hymn, the
            laying on of hands, the anointing of the sick&mdash;are
            but so many ceremonies serving as models of the
            ceremonies used by the Catholic Church in her public
            worship and in the administration of her sacraments.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a name="ceremony_2" id="ceremony_2">II. Vestments Used
            by the Priest at Mass</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            <font size="+3">B</font>EFORE entering upon an
            explanation of the ceremonies of the Mass, which is our
            principal act of public worship, let us examine the
            meaning of the vestments worn by the priest during the
            celebration of that august sacrifice. First, it is well
            to remember that these vestments come down to us from
            the time of the apostles, and have the weight of
            antiquity hanging upon them. Hence, if they did not
            demand our respect as memorials of Christ, they are at
            least deserving of attention on account of their
            antiquity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 28th chapter of Exodus tells us the sacred
            vestments God wished the priests of the Old Law to wear
            during the public worship. "And these shall be the
            vestments which they shall make: a rational and an
            ephod, a tunic and a straight linen garment, a mitre
            and a girdle. They shall make the holy vestments for
            thy brother Aaron and his sons, that they may do the
            office of priesthood unto Me." As God in the Old Law
            prescribed vestments for the priests, so the Church,
            guided by God, prescribes sacred vestments to be worn
            by the priest of the New Law while engaged in the
            sacred mysteries.
        </p>
        <p>
            The long black garment which the priest wears around
            the church in all the sacred functions is called a
            <i>cassock</i>. Kings and officers of the army wear a
            special uniform when performing their public duties;
            priests wear <i>cassocks</i> and other special garments
            when performing their public duties. These vestments
            are used to excite the minds of the faithful to the
            contemplation of heavenly things.

            Who, for example, can behold the cross on the chasuble
            the priest wears without thinking of all Christ
            suffered for us on the cross? As the priest in
            celebrating Mass represents the person of Christ, and
            the Mass represents His passion, the vestments he wears
            represent those with which Christ was clothed at the
            time of the passion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first vestment the priest puts on over the
            <i>cassock</i> is called an <i>amice</i>. It is made of
            linen, and reminds us of the veil that covered the face
            of Jesus when His persecutors struck Him. (<i>Luke</i>
            xxii. 64.)
        </p>
        <p>
            When the priest puts on the <i>amice</i> he first
            places it on his head, thus recalling to mind the crown
            of thorns that pierced the head of Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <i>alb</i> (from <i>albus</i>, white) represents
            the white garment with which Christ was vested by Herod
            when sent back to Pilate dressed as a fool.
            (<i>Luke</i> xxii. 11.)
        </p>
        <p>
            White is emblematic of purity. Hence the wearer is
            reminded of that purity of mind and body which he
            should have who serves the altar of the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <i>cincture</i>, or girdle, as well as the
            <i>maniple</i> and <i>stole</i>, represent the cords
            and bands with which Christ was bound in the different
            stages of His passion. St. Matthew says in the 22d
            verse of the 27th chapter, "They brought Him
            <i>bound</i> and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate, the
            governor."
        </p>
        <p>
            The <i>chasuble</i>, or outer vestment the priest
            wears, represents the purple garment with which Christ
            was clothed as a mock king. "And they clothed Him with
            purple" (<i>Mark</i> xv. 17). Upon the back of the
            <i>chasuble</i> you see a cross. This represents the
            cross Christ bore on His sacred shoulders to Calvary,
            and upon which He was crucified.
        </p>
        <p>
            In these vestments, that is, in the <i>chasuble</i>,
            <i>stole</i>, and <i>maniple</i>, the Church uses five
            colors&mdash;white, red, purple, green, and black.
        </p>
        <p>
            White, which is symbolic of purity and innocence, is
            used on the feasts of Our Lord, of the Blessed Virgin,
            of the angels, and of the saints that were not martyrs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Red, the symbol of fortitude, is used on the feast of
            Pentecost, of the Exaltation of the Cross, of the
            apostles and martyrs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Purple, or violet (the color of penance), is used in
            Advent and Lent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Green (the color of hope) is used on all Sundays when
            no special feast is celebrated, except the Sundays of
            Lent and Advent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Black (the color of mourning) is used on Good Friday
            and during the celebration of Mass for the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus we see that each vestment and color used has a
            special significance.
        </p>
        <p>
            All are calculated to attract our attention, elevate
            our minds to God, and fill us with a desire to do
            something for Him Who has done so much for us&mdash;to
            at least keep His commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
            One word about the use of Latin in the celebration of
            Mass will perhaps be appropriate here. History tells us
            that when Christianity was established the Roman Empire
            had control of nearly all of Europe, Asia, and Africa.
            Wherever the Roman flag floated to the breeze the Latin
            language was spoken, just as English is spoken where
            the sovereign of Great Britain or the President of the
            United States holds sway. The Church naturally adopted
            in her liturgy the language spoken by the people.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the beginning of the fifth century vast hordes of
            barbarians began to come from the north of Europe and
            spread desolation over the fairest portions of the
            Roman Empire. Soon the Empire was broken up. New
            kingdoms began to be formed, new languages to be
            developed. The Latin finally ceased to be a living
            language. The Church retained it in her liturgy, 1st,
            because, as her doctrine and liturgy are unchangeable,
            she wishes the language of her doctrine and liturgy to
            be unchangeable; 2d, because, as the Church is spread
            over the whole world, embracing in her fold children of
            all climes, nations, and languages&mdash;as she is
            universal&mdash;she must have a universal language; 3d,
            because the Catholic clergy are in constant
            communication with the Holy See, and this requires a
            uniform language.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides, when a priest says Mass the people, by their
            English Missals or other prayer-books, are able to
            follow him from beginning to end.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Mass is a sacrifice. The prayers of the Mass are
            offered to God. Hence when the priest says Mass he is
            speaking not to the people, but to God, to whom all
            languages are equally intelligible. Are not these
            sufficient reasons for the use of the Latin language?
            Are not good Catholics more attentive, more devout at
            Mass than others at their prayer-meetings? The good
            Catholic knows that the Mass represents the passion and
            death of Christ; that the passion and death of Christ
            are the sinner's only refuge, the just man's only hope;
            that it can not but be good and wholesome to turn our
            minds and our hearts toward this subject; that frequent
            meditation on Christ's passion will move us to avoid
            sin, which caused it; and that nothing can more
            efficaciously cause us to think of Christ's passion and
            death than the holy sacrifice of the Mass.

        <p>
            <font size="+3">T</font>HE Mass is the great sacrifice
            of the New Law. It was foreshadowed by all the
            sacrifices ordained by God in the Old Law. They were
            shadows; it is the substance.
        </p>
        <p>
            We learn from Genesis of the fall of man. Universal
            tradition, as well as Scripture, informs us that the
            creature formerly became guilty in the eyes of the
            Creator. All nations, all peoples, endeavored to
            appease the anger of Heaven and believed that a victim
            was necessary for this purpose. Hence sacrifices have
            been offered from the beginning of the human race.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cain and Abel offered victims; the one the first fruits
            of the earth, the other the firstlings of the flock.
            Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Melchisedech worshiped this
            way, and their worship was acceptable to God.
            Everywhere, even among the heathen, you find the altar,
            the priest, and the sacrifice. As we learn from
            Leviticus and other portions of the Old Testament, God
            Himself carefully prescribed the quality, manner,
            number, and place of the various sacrifices which He
            was pleased to accept from the hands of His chosen
            people. From this fact that sacrifice has ever formed a
            prominent feature in the worship of all people, we
            conclude that it belongs to the essentials of religion,
            and that Christians to-day should have an altar of
            which, as St. Paul says, "they can not eat who serve
            the tabernacle."
        </p>
        <p>
            The sacrifices of the Old Law were provisional and
            prefigured the great sacrifice of the New Law foretold
            by the prophet Malachy. This glorious prophecy of
            Malachy, "From the rising of the sun even to the going
            down My name is great among the Gentiles; in every
            place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to My
            name a clean offering; for My name is great among the
            Gentiles, saith the Lord of Hosts"&mdash;this glorious
            prophecy is fulfilled only by the great sacrifice of
            the Catholic Church. We alone can say with St. Paul,
            "<i>Habemus altare</i>" "We have an altar" and a true
            sacrifice. Of all the blessings bequeathed by Jesus
            Christ to His Church, there is none better, none
            greater, none holier than the holy sacrifice of the
            Mass. It is the sacrifice of His own body and blood
            offered to the heavenly Father under the appearances of
            bread and wine. It was instituted by Our Lord at the
            Last Supper, when He took bread and wine in His sacred
            hands and blessed them, saying, "This is My body. . . .
            This is My blood. . . . Do this for a remembrance of
            Me."
        </p>
        <p>
            He instituted the holy Mass in order to represent and
            continue the sacrifice of Calvary. St Paul says, in his
            first epistle to the Corinthians, xi. 26, that it was
            instituted to show the death of the Lord until His
            second coming. After the consecration, which the priest
            effects by saying over the bread and wine the same
            words which Jesus Christ said at the Last Supper, there
            is no longer bread and wine, but the true and living
            Jesus Christ, God and man, hidden under the appearances
            of bread and wine, just as in the manger He was hidden
            under the appearance of an infant. The priest offers
            Him up to His heavenly Father in the name of the
            Catholic Church, or rather He offers Himself up, and we
            can confidently hope that we will obtain more through
            prayers at the holy Mass than through our own unaided
            prayers. In order to have part in the holy sacrifice of
            the Mass a person should follow the actions and prayers
            of the priest, especially at the offertory,
            consecration, and communion; meditate on the passion of
            Christ; say the rosary or the prayers in the
            prayer-books, at the same time uniting his intention
            with the intention of the sacrificing priest.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sacrifice of the Mass is a true sacrifice, because
            it is the oblation of a victim to God to represent by
            its destruction or change His supreme dominion over
            life and death. It is offered to satisfy our four great
            debts and wants in adoration to God on account of His
            omnipotence, in thanksgiving for His benefits, in
            atonement for our sins, and to obtain His assistance in
            difficulties and temptations. The holy Mass obtains for
            us all graces and blessings, temporal and spiritual.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the Mass is the highest act of public worship, it
            is proper that it should be celebrated with fitting
            sacred ceremonies. Every ceremony which the Church
            prescribes has its deep significance. All tend to bring
            before our minds the mystery of the passion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <i>altar</i>, which is reached by means of steps,
            represents Mount Calvary, upon which Christ died with
            His arms extended as if to enfold all men as brothers.
            The <i>crucifix</i> recalls Jesus dying on the cross.
            The <i>lighted candles</i> are symbols of the faith and
            devotion which ought to burn in the hearts of the
            faithful when present at Mass. The <i>sacred
            vestments</i>, embroidered with the sign of the cross,
            indicate that the priest is the minister and visible
            representative of Jesus Christ, the invisible priest.
            The sign of the cross made many times by the priest
            over the host and chalice reminds us that we offer to
            God the divine Victim of the cross, and that we ought
            to unite ourselves to Him by loving the cross, by
            patience and Christian penance. We genuflect because
            Our Lord is really present. If we know He is not
            present on the altar we bow in honor of the place where
            He sometimes reposes. <i>Holy water</i> is used to
            signify that our souls must be pure if we wish God to
            answer our prayers. <i>Incense</i> is used at solemn
            High Mass and at Vespers. It is symbolic of prayer,
            agreeably to the words of the 140th psalm: "Let my
            prayer, O Lord, be directed as incense in Thy sight."
            And St. John, describing the heavenly Jerusalem in the
            8th chapter of the Apocalypse, says: "Another angel
            came, and stood before the altar, having a golden
            censer; and there was given him much incense, that he
            should offer of the prayers of all saints upon the
            golden altar which is before the throne of God."
        </p>
        <p>
            The sacrifice of the Mass, then, is the sacrifice of
            Calvary, since the same Victim is offered up and by the
            same High Priest, Jesus Christ. The Emanuel, the God
            with us, the thought of whom made the prophets tremble
            centuries before He came, that divine Teacher who loves
            to dwell with the children of men, the Catholic Church
            beholds dwelling in the midst of us on our altars. If
            you have visited some of our ancient cathedrals, or any
            of our magnificent modern churches, and admired the
            varied ornaments or artistic wonders therein; if you
            have ever been present at our religious solemnities and
            witnessed the gravity of our ceremonies, the beauty of
            the chants, the piety of the adorers; if you have
            reflected upon the spirit of sacrifice and
            self-forgetfulness so common to Catholicism and so
            unknown elsewhere&mdash;that spirit which moves
            thousands of the young of both sexes to forsake the
            world and devote themselves to the care of the sick,
            the education of the young, and to other works of
            charity&mdash;if you have witnessed these things and
            reflected upon them, you can not but have asked
            yourself why are such gorgeous temples built; why such
            magnificent works of art as displayed on the altar, the
            sacred vessels, paintings, and other things in the
            church? What prompts such sacrifices? And the answer
            will be, because the church is the edifice where God in
            the holy Mass daily renews the prodigies of His mercy,
            and it can never be worthy of His love; because God,
            who sacrificed Himself for us, is ever with us in the
            Blessed Sacrament of the altar, to soothe our cares and
            answer our prayers. Yes, the grand feature of the
            Catholic Church is the holy altar. On the altar is the
            tabernacle for the residence of the Lord of Hosts.
        </p>
        <p>
            There our "hidden God," Jesus in the Eucharist, dwells
            night and day in the midst of His people, saying to
            them with words of love, "Come to me all you that are
            burdened and heavy laden, and I will refresh you."
        </p>
        <p>
            The Mass, independent of its sacrificial aspect,
            consists of the best prayers ever uttered. The priest
            begins by making the sign of the cross, "In the name of
            the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."
            This sign is an epitome of the Christian's belief in
            the unity and trinity of God and in the incarnation and
            death of Jesus Christ. After making the sign of the
            cross he repeats the 42d psalm, "Judge me, O God," and
            then makes an humble confession of his sins to God. He
            ascends the altar and nine times asks God to have mercy
            on him, <i>Kyrie Eleison</i>; then follows the
            beautiful hymn the shepherds heard the angels singing
            at the birth of the Saviour, <i>Gloria in Excelsis
            Deo</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The prayer of the feast, the epistle and gospel follow,
            and then the sermon in the vernacular is usually
            preached. After the Nicene Creed, <i>Credo in Unum
            Deum</i>, the priest makes the offering of bread and
            wine. He then washes the tips of his fingers, saying:
            "I will wash my hands among the innocent," by which he
            is reminded to be free from stain to offer worthily the
            Holy Sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
            The preface, canon, and solemn words of consecration
            follow, during which the bread and wine are changed by
            the power of Jesus Christ into His body and blood. In a
            short time he comes to the best of all prayers, the
            prayer taught us by Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
            the Our Father, <i>Pater Noster</i>. The <i>Agnus
            Dei</i> follows, then the communion, when he partakes
            of the consecrated bread and wine, and afterward gives
            holy communion to the faithful. He then continues the
            Mass, gives his blessing, and finishes the Mass with
            the beginning of the Gospel of St. John. Hence you see
            that, besides the great sacrifice which makes it an act
            worthy of God, the Mass consists of the best of all
            prayers.
        </p>
        <p>
            From what has been said it is evident that ceremonies
            in the worship of God are reasonable, being sanctioned
            by God in the Old and New Testaments; that the holy
            sacrifice of the Mass is the greatest of all acts of
            worship; and that the Catholic Church in using
            ceremonies is but following the example of Our Lord and
            Saviour Jesus Christ and His apostles. St. John in the
            Book of Revelations tells us that before the throne of
            God angels stand with golden censers, multitudes from
            all nations follow and adore the Lamb, while virgins
            sing the new song which they alone can utter. So, too,
            before the throne of God on earth we swing our censers,
            multitudes from all nations prostrate themselves in
            adoration, the sweet incense of their praise and prayer
            ascends to the throne of grace, their minds are
            enlightened by God's word, while their hearts are

        <p>
            The Son of God, after having taught us by His word,
            shown us by His example, and merited for us by His
            grace the virtues necessary for salvation, wished to
            institute the holy sacrifice of the Mass, that He might
            come Himself in the Holy Sacrament and imprint them
            upon us. Of these virtues, the most important are
            <i>humility</i>, <i>purity</i>, <i>obedience</i>,
            <i>patience</i>, and <i>charity</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us always ask God when present at the holy Mass for
            a lively faith in His <i>Real Presence</i>, an ardent
            love for Him in the Blessed Sacrament of the altar, and
            the grace to imitate His humility, His purity, His
            meekness, obedience, patience, and charity <i>here</i>,
            and enjoy His presence forever <i>hereafter</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following beautiful words of Cardinal Newman show
            that the Mass is something more than a mere form of
            words, and that ceremonies are reasonable as well as
            necessary in its celebration:
        </p>
        <p>
            "To me nothing is so consoling, so piercing, so
            thrilling, so overcoming, as the Mass said as it is
            among us. I could attend Masses forever and not be
            tired. It is not a mere form of words&mdash;it is a
            great action, the greatest action that can be on earth.
            It is not the invocation merely, but, if I dare use the
            word, the evocation of the Eternal. He becomes present
            on the altar in flesh and blood, before Whom angels bow
            and devils tremble. This is that awful event which is
            the scope and the interpretation of every part of the
            solemnity. Words are necessary, but as means, not as
            ends; they are not mere addresses to the throne of
            grace, they are instruments of what is far higher, of
            consecration, of sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
            "They hurry on as if impatient to fulfil their mission.
            Quickly they go, for they are awful words of sacrifice;
            they are a work too great to delay upon, as when it was
            said in the beginning, 'What thou doest, do quickly.'
            Quickly they pass, for the Lord Jesus goes with them,
            as He passed along the lake in the days of His flesh,
            quickly calling first one and then another; quickly
            they pass, because as the lightning which shineth from
            one part of the heaven unto the other, so is the coming
            of the Son of Man.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Quickly they pass, for they are as the words of Moses,
            when the Lord came down in the cloud, calling on the
            name of the Lord as He passed by, 'The Lord, the Lord
            God, merciful and generous, long suffering, and
            abundant in goodness and truth.' And as Moses on the
            mountain, so we, too, make haste and bow our heads to
            the earth and adore.
        </p>
        <p>
            "So we, all around, each in his place, look for the
            great Advent 'waiting for the moving of the water,'
            each in his place, with his own heart, with his own
            wants, with his own prayers, separate but concordant,
            watching what is going on, watching its progress,
            uniting in its consummation; not painfully, and
            hopelessly following a hard form of prayer from
            beginning to end, but like a concert of musical
            instruments each different, but concurring in sweet
            harmony, we take our post with God's priest, supporting
            him, yet guided by him. There are little children
            there, and old men, and simple laborers, and students
            in seminaries, priests preparing for Mass, priests
            making their thanksgiving, there are innocent maidens,
            and there are penitent sinners; but out of these many
            minds rises one Eucharistic hymn, and the great action
            is the measure and the scope of it."

            <font size="+3">T</font>HIS commandment teaches us that
            God wills the whole Sunday to be spent in His honor. We
            should sanctify it by good works, and by assisting at
            divine service. On that day servile works and improper
            amusements are forbidden. A salutary rest and moderate
            recreation are allowed, but never at the expense of
            duties of obligation. After hearing Mass on Sunday
            morning, which is obligatory on all Catholics, there is
            no better way of sanctifying the remainder of the day
            than by attending Vespers and Benediction.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Vesper service is a small portion of the divine
            office, which priests must recite daily, for God's
            honor and glory. It consists of five of the psalms of
            David (Dixit Dominus, Ps. 109; Confitebor tibi, Ps.
            110; Beatus vir, Ps. 111; Laudate pueri, Ps. 112; In
            exitu Israel, Ps. 113, or Laudate Dominum, Ps. 116), a
            hymn, the Magnificat, or canticle of the Virgin Mary,
            from the first chapter of St. Luke, and some prayers.
            Is it not reasonable thus to praise God in psalms and
            hymns and spiritual canticles?
        </p>
        <p>
            Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament usually follows
            Vespers. The Catholic Church teaches that Jesus Christ
            is really present in the Blessed Sacrament. The
            reasonableness of this teaching will be seen in the
            following article.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since Jesus Christ is present, He ought to be adored by
            the faithful. Faithful adorers frequently visit Him in
            the Blessed Sacrament and worship Him in "spirit and in
            truth." Hence, the Blessed Sacrament is kept in the
            Tabernacle on our altars to soothe our cares, answer
            our prayers, and be ready at any time to be
            administered to the sick and dying.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides our private devotion to the Blessed Sacrament,
            the Church has appointed solemn rites to show publicly
            our faith and devotion toward the Real Presence of
            Jesus Christ. These rites are processions on Corpus
            Christi, the Forty Hours' devotion, and, especially,
            the rite called Benediction.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it is time for Benediction many candles are
            lighted on the altar. This is done to show our faith in
            the Real Presence of Jesus Christ. If He were not
            present, this display would be unreasonable,
            unnecessary, and meaningless. But the candles we light,
            the incense we burn, the flowers and other ornaments we
            use to decorate the altar, and all that we do for Our
            Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ can not be too much.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything being prepared, the priest takes the Blessed
            Sacrament out of the tabernacle, and, placing it in the
            ostensorium, exposes it on an elevated throne, while
            the choir sings in honor of the Blessed Sacrament the
            hymn "O Salutaris Hostia," "O Saving Host." The priest
            incenses Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament, as,
            according to the Apocalypse, angels do in heaven.
            Another hymn or a litany follows; after which is sung
            the "Tantum Ergo," "Down in adoration falling,"
            followed by a prayer by the priest. Then in the midst
            of a solemn silence (except that a small bell is
            tinkled) the priest takes the monstrance, or
            ostensorium, containing the Blessed Sacrament, and,
            turning toward the people, makes with it the sign of
            the cross over them, thus blessing the faithful with
            the Most Holy One.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is certainly a most touching and impressive rite
            even to those who do not believe in it. Cardinal Newman
            calls it one of the most beautiful, natural, and
            soothing practices of the Church. No one will deny that
            this practice, or rite of the Church, is reasonable, if
            Jesus Christ is really present in the Blessed
            Sacrament. That He is really present is our belief.
            This being our belief, is it not reasonable to light
            candles as a sign of spiritual joy, and thus to show
            our faith in Him who is the light of the world? He gave
            us all that we have. He gave us the beautiful world we
            dwell upon with its variety of scenery&mdash;with its
            snow-capped mountains, its green-carpeted hills, and
            its blooming valleys. He has no need of our gifts; for
            the earth is His "and the fulness thereof." Yet as He
            was pleased to receive the gifts of the Magi and the
            precious ointment of Mary, so, too, is He pleased to
            receive our offerings. And is anything too good, too
            beautiful, too precious, for Him? Can the altar on
            which He dwells be too richly adorned? Are the pure
            candles we light, the sweet incense we burn, the choice
            flowers and costly ornaments with which we decorate the
            altar, too much to use in honor of Our Lord and our
            God? Yes, the Catholic practice or rite of Benediction
            is dictated by right reason. Everything connected with
            Benediction is reasonable, beautiful, and suggestive of
            the <i>noblest sentiments of the heart of man</i>.

        <p>
            By the Real Presence is meant that Jesus Christ is

            If the reader will take up his Bible and read carefully
            the 6th chapter of the Gospel according to St. John;
            the 26th chapter, 26th, 27th, and 28th verses of St.
            Matthew; the 14th chapter, 22d verse of St. Mark; the
            First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians, 10th
            chapter, 16th verse, as well as other portions of the
            New Testament, he will certainly see that the Catholic
            teaching and practice concerning the Real Presence of
            Jesus Christ in the Blessed Sacrament are founded on
            Scripture. In this 6th chapter of St. John, we learn
            that before instituting the Blessed Sacrament Our
            Saviour wished to announce or promise it to His
            disciples in order to prepare them for it. He first
            gave them a figure of the Blessed Sacrament in the
            multiplication of the five loaves of bread by which He
            fed five thousand persons. After this miracle He told
            them that He would give them bread superior to that
            which they had eaten, and that this bread was His own
            flesh and blood. "The bread that I will give is My
            flesh, for the life of the world." It is almost
            impossible to understand these words of Our Lord in any
            other than a literal sense. He was so understood by
            those who heard Him. "How can this man give us his
            flesh to eat?" they said, and many withdrew from Him.
            It is but reasonable to believe that if He did not wish
            to be understood in a literal sense He would have told
            His hearers so, rather than have them leave Him.
        </p>
        <p>
            This promise of a doctrine so difficult to understand
            was fulfilled at the Last Supper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke, and gave
            to His disciples, and said: "Take ye and eat. This is
            My body." And taking the chalice He gave thanks; and
            gave to them, saying: "Drink ye all of this. For this
            is My blood of the new testament which shall be shed
            for many for the remission of sins."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do this for a commemoration of Me."
        </p>
        <p>
            These are substantially the words of SS. Matthew, Mark,
            Luke, and of the apostle Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 10th chapter of the First Epistle to the
            Corinthians, St. Paul says: "The chalice of benediction
            which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of
            Christ? And the bread which we break, is it not the
            partaking of the body of the Lord?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Any one of these texts abundantly proves the Catholic
            doctrine of the Real Presence, and shows the
            reasonableness of the Catholic practice regarding the
            Blessed Sacrament. Reflect upon them. Reflect
            especially upon the words of Christ, "This is My body."
            Think what an insult it is to the divinity and veracity
            of Christ to doubt His word, because you can not
            understand how what appears to be bread is in reality
            His own body and blood.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you remember that Jesus Christ is God, that He had
            the power to make this change, that He could confer
            this power on others, as the apostles and their
            successors, that He did so when He said: "Do this in
            commemoration of Me," and that this change at the
            present time as at the time of the apostles is made by
            His almighty power, you will have no difficulty in
            believing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The belief and practice of the Catholic Church of
            to-day regarding the Blessed Sacrament is the same as
            it was in every age since the time of Christ. The
            history of every century tells us this. The Fathers,
            Doctors, and Church writers of every age say the same.
            If it were not so, some one ought to be able to find
            the time when the doctrine was invented, and the person
            who invented it. But, since no one has been able to
            find the inventor of this doctrine and practice, the
            time or place of the invention, we rightly conclude
            that they came down to us from the time of Christ, and
            had Christ for an author. (Berengarius, in the eleventh
            century, was the first who denied this doctrine.) If,
            then, Christ is the author, is not the Catholic
            practice reasonable?
        </p>
        <p>
            But I don't understand the Catholic doctrine regarding
            the Blessed Sacrament, some one may say; therefore it
            is contrary to reason. Dear reader, did the consummate
            puerility, silliness, foolishness of such an objection
            ever present itself to you? Do you understand the
            Blessed Trinity? And is it contrary to reason? No.
            Although above reason, it is not against it. Do you
            understand how Jesus Christ is both God and man? Do you
            understand any mystery? No. If you did it would no
            longer be a mystery. For a mystery is something above
            human intelligence. It is something incomprehensible to
            us, for it pertains to the divine intelligence. And as
            well might you attempt to pour the mighty ocean into a
            small hole on the shore, as attempt to hold with your
            limited capacity the illimitable ocean of divinity. The
            proper office of reason is to examine the evidences of
            revelation, and see if God has spoken. But it
            constitutes no part of its office to dispute the word
            of God. That God has spoken is evident from the
            fulfilment of many prophecies and the authority of many
            miracles. That these prophecies have been fulfilled,
            and these miracles performed, is as certain as is any
            historical fact. Reason teaches us this. It teaches us,
            too, that no one but God (or by the power of God) can
            prophesy; no one but God can derogate from the order of
            nature, by the performance of a miracle. Reason teaches
            us, then, that God has spoken. When we know God speaks,
            genuine reason will dictate that we humbly believe His
            holy word. Thus will true reason ever act. And when God
            says, "This is My body," it will not hesitate to
            believe.
        </p>
        <p>
            We all believe that at the baptism of Our Saviour by
            St. John Baptist, the Holy Ghost appeared in the form
            of a dove. Now, is it not as reasonable for Jesus
            Christ, the second person of the Blessed Trinity, to
            appear in the form of bread as it was for the Holy
            Ghost, the third person of the Trinity, to appear in
            the form of a dove? We must therefore admit that the
            Catholic doctrine of the Real Presence of Jesus Christ
            in the Blessed Sacrament is reasonable; that it has
            been believed by the Christian Church of every age from
            the time of Christ until the present time; and that it
            is taught by SS. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and by
            St. Paul in clear and unmistakable terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, dear reader, since Jesus Christ is really present,
            is not the Catholic practice regarding the Blessed
            Sacrament reasonable? Should we not honor Our Lord and
            Our God? Should we not adore Him as really present in
            the Blessed Sacrament? Should we not frequently receive
            Him with pure and contrite hearts? Should we not, when
            we enter the church, genuflect, bend the knee in His
            honor? Should we not show Him every mark of respect and
            devotion? Can we do too much in His honor? Let us,
            then, adore Our Lord and Our God, for we are His people
            and the sheep of His pasture. Let us return love for
            love to the great King of suffering, who was born for
            love of us, who died for love of us, and who, for love
            of us, remains ever with us in the Blessed Sacrament.
            Let us ask that our faith and love may persevere to the
            end; that loving and adoring Him here in the Blessed
            Sacrament of His love, <i>we may be united with Him
            forever hereafter</i>.

            <font size="+3">H</font>OLY communion is receiving the
            body and blood of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament. The
            clergy when saying Mass, except on Good Friday, receive
            under both forms. When not celebrating Mass, they
            receive only the one kind, the consecrated bread. In
            the early ages of the Church communion was given to the
            people under both forms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The faithful, however, could, if they wished, dispense
            with one form and receive under the form of bread. This
            shows that the Church always taught that Christ is
            entire both under the form of bread and under the form
            of wine. At one time the faithful received under both
            forms; now they receive under one form, the form of
            bread. It is merely a matter of discipline, which the
            Church could change, if circumstances demanded it.
            Whether you receive under one form or both, you receive
            whole and entire the body and blood of Christ. This is
            clearly taught by St. Paul in the 11th chapter of the
            First Epistle to the Corinthians, where he says:
            "Whosoever shall eat this bread, <i>or</i> drink the
            chalice of the Lord <i>unworthily</i>, shall be guilty
            of the body <i>and</i> blood of the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
            How could a person eating that bread unworthily be
            guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, unless the
            body and blood of the Lord were there under the form of
            bread?
        </p>
        <p>
            Since Jesus Christ is whole and entire under the form
            of bread, as well as under the form of wine, the
            practice of the Catholic Church of giving holy
            communion under one form is reasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good Christians frequently receive their Lord and their
            God in holy communion. He inspires them with feelings
            of love, gratitude, and adoration. He reminds them to
            think frequently of their Creator&mdash;to give Him
            their first thoughts in the morning and their last in
            the evening. He gives them strength to restrain their
            guilty passions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Holy Communion is the seed of immortality. "He that

            Apostles, he whom Christ afterward made head of His
            Church&mdash;thrice denied his Lord and his God.

            After the descent of the Holy Ghost, what a change!
            What a wonderful transformation! They who before had

        </p>
        <p>
            In a similar way does Confirmation act on the receiver.
            Confirmation is that sacrament in which, by the
            imposition of the bishop's hands, we receive the Holy
            Ghost to make us strong and perfect Christians and
            soldiers of Jesus Christ. It is the second in the order
            of the sacraments, because the early Christians were
            accustomed to receive it immediately after Baptism. In
            the 8th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles we find the
            first recorded instance of the administering of
            Confirmation by the apostles. Here we are told that St.
            Peter and St. John confirmed the Samaritans who had
            been baptized by Philip. "They prayed for them that
            they might receive the Holy Ghost. . . . Then they laid
            their hands upon them, and they received the Holy
            Ghost." In a similar way does the bishop, the successor
            of the apostles, administer Confirmation at the present
            day. First, he turns toward those to be confirmed and
            says: "May the Holy Ghost come down upon you and the
            power of the Most High keep you from sin." Then
            extending his hands over them he prays that they may
            receive the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 6th verse of the 19th chapter of the Acts the
            sacred writer, after telling about the baptism of the
            disciples at Ephesus, adds: "And when Paul had laid his
            hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them." In the
            6th chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews St. Paul
            mentions Confirmation, the laying on of hands, with
            Baptism and Penance, as among the principal practices
            of Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sacrament of Confirmation has been administered to
            the faithful of every age from the time of Christ until
            the present. We learn this from the Fathers and writers
            of the various ages. Among them St. Clement says: "All
            must make haste to be confirmed by a bishop, and
            receive the sevenfold grace of the Holy Ghost." The
            practice of administering Confirmation is founded on
            tradition, then, as well as on Scripture. Is it not
            reasonable to believe and practise that which the
            Christian Church of every age believed and practised?
        </p>
        <p>
            The apostles of Christ administered Confirmation by
            praying that the faithful may receive the Holy Ghost
            and laying their hands upon them. The successors of the
            apostles do likewise. Who will say that this practice
            is not reasonable? Baptism gives spiritual life;
            Confirmation increases it. Baptism makes persons
            children of God; Confirmation strengthens them, causes
            them to grow, and makes them strong men and soldiers of
            Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the morality of life is implied in the sacrament of
            Confirmation. It strengthens man, it gives him courage
            to confess God; and as sin is the denial of God,
            whoever has courage to confess <i>God will practise
            virtue</i>.

            "The angel Gabriel was sent from God . . . to a Virgin
            . . . and the Virgin's name was Mary. And the angel
            being come in said to her: Hail, full of grace, the
            Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women"

        <p>
            <font size="+3">T</font>HESE words from St. Luke show
            that the Catholic practice of honoring Mary is
            scriptural. We alone fulfil the prophecy, "From
            henceforth all generations shall call me blessed." If
            Mary was so pure that the archangel Gabriel could
            salute her as full of grace; if she was so perfect as
            to be honored, respected, and loved by her divine Son,
            Jesus Christ, is it not reasonable that we, too, should
            honor, respect, and love her?
        </p>
        <p>
            How we honor the sword of Washington! What a cluster of
            tender recollections clings to the staff of Franklin!
            Is there a loyal American citizen who does not think
            with feelings of love and respect of the mother of our
            Revolutionary hero, or who would not doff his hat at
            the unveiling of a statue of the sage of Monticello?
            And why? Is it on account of their intrinsic merit? No.
            We honor them principally on account of the relation
            they bear to those three brightest stars in the
            American firmament. So it is with the honor we show to
            Mary, the Mother of God. Although she was an example of
            all virtues, we honor her principally because it was
            through her instrumentality He was born by whom we
            achieved not civil liberty, but the liberty of the
            children of God. She did not draw lightning from
            heaven, nor the scepter from kings; but she brought
            forth Him who is the Lord of heaven and King of kings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The principal reason, then, why we honor Mary is
            because she is the Mother of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus
            Christ. This honor consists of love, respect, and
            veneration. We love her with an interior love, a love
            proceeding from the heart; nor should we fear to let
            this love appear outwardly. When others revile her,
            speak disrespectfully of her, we should shrink from the
            very idea of acting similarly toward her. We should
            then remember that she is the Mother of Our Saviour,
            and should ask ourselves how we would have acted toward
            her had we lived in her day and been witnesses of the
            honor shown her by her divine Son. By so doing we will
            show her that love which is her due. Our respect, our
            veneration for her, should be affectionate and deep.
            When we remember that it was her hand that first lifted
            from the ground and received in maternal embrace the
            sacred body of Jesus, just born and just dead; when we
            think how respectfully Elizabeth greeted her; when we
            recall to mind the reverent salutation of the
            archangel; when we consider the honor shown her by the
            apostles and by her own divine Son, can we help feeling
            a deep love, respect, and veneration for her? You see,
            dear reader, honoring Mary is scriptural and
            reasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
            But if we should honor her principally because she is
            the Mother of God, we should also honor her because she
            is the peerless glory, the matchless jewel of her sex.
            She constitutes a sole exception to a general law. Sin
            never contaminated, never touched her fair soul. This
            is what we mean by the Immaculate Conception.
        </p>
        <p>
            God created the first man free from sin. But he
            transgressed the law of God, and, by his transgression,
            all his posterity are born in sin and conceived in
            iniquity. For St. Paul says: "By one man sin entered
            into this world, and by sin death; and so death passed
            upon all men, in whom all have sinned" (<i>Rom.</i> v.
            12). But God promised that the woman, Mary, should
            crush the head of the serpent. Now if she was to crush
            the head of the serpent, it was fit that she should
            never be under his power, that she should be pure, free
            from sin of every kind.
        </p>
        <p>
            There have been exceptions to all general laws. At the
            time of the deluge Noe was saved. Lot was saved from
            the destruction of Sodom. In like manner, the Blessed
            Virgin is an exception to the general law that all
            sinned in Adam. Isaias and St. John Baptist were
            sanctified in their mother's womb. Was it any more
            difficult for God to sanctify Mary at the moment of her
            conception, at the moment of the union of her soul with
            her body? God chose His own Mother. If He had the power
            to choose her did He not also have the power to
            preserve her from original sin? And does it not appear
            to you most fitting that God, the Holy Ghost, should
            preserve His spouse, and God, the Son, His Mother, from
            sin of every kind?
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hail, full of grace," the angel said to her. If she
            was full of grace, no vacancy was left for sin. Grace
            denotes the absence of sin, as light denotes the
            absence of darkness. Hence if Mary was full of grace,
            she was never subject to sin; she was always pure and
            her conception immaculate. It is but natural, then,
            that we arrive at the belief in the Immaculate
            Conception, at the belief in the sinlessness, the
            spotlessness of the Blessed Virgin from the very
            beginning of her existence. If we honor Mary
            principally because the angel honored her, because God
            honored her, we honor her, also, because of her
            immaculate conception and total freedom from sin. She
            was a model of all virtues. Is it not reasonable, then,
            to honor Mary, to love her, and to believe that she
            loves us? If we honor the good and virtuous, where can
            we find a nobler example of virtue than Mary? What a
            beautiful model Mary is for Christians, and especially
            for Christian women! Good Catholic mothers are
            continually urging upon their daughters the necessity
            of choosing as a model Mary, the true type of female
            excellence. In Mary you find all that is tender,
            loving, constant, and true. In her you find all
            virtues. In her humility she refused the highest
            honors; while in patience she endured more anguish and
            agony than any other creature on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mary is a creature of God. As the praise we bestow on a
            beautiful picture redounds to the glory of the artist,
            so the honor we give Mary redounds to God, since we
            honor her for His sake. Let us honor her. That person
            who honors the Blessed Virgin; who loves, respects, and
            venerates her as the Mother of God; who takes her as a
            model and imitates her virtues; who prays to her in
            trials and afflictions and asks her intercession with
            her divine Son, does not only act in a reasonable
            manner, but such action is certain to make the path
            through this world smooth and easy and at the same time
            safe to a life of <i>eternal happiness</i>.

            the deaf, and raised the dead to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The healing of the body, however, was to Him a
            secondary object. The healing of the soul was His
            mission on earth. He frequently called the attention of
            His followers to this. For example, He cured the man of
            the palsy to prove that as man He had the power to
            forgive sins. Another example is when He gives us in
            the cure of the lepers a figure of sin and its cure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leprosy has always been considered a figure of sin. As
            leprosy covers the body and makes it disgusting and
            frightful to behold, so sin covers the soul and makes
            it hideous in the sight of God. The Old Law required
            lepers to separate themselves from society until their
            cure was certified to by the priests who were appointed
            for this purpose. Our Lord has been pleased, in the New
            Law, to institute a similar method for the cure of the
            more fatal leprosy of sin. The spiritual leper, the
            sinner, is to show himself to the priest, make known
            the diseased state of his soul, and submit to the
            inspection and treatment of the priest, who is the
            divinely appointed physician of the soul. But should we
            not go directly to God, since God alone has power to
            justify us? It is true, God alone can effect our
            justification; but He has appointed the priest to judge
            in His place and pass sentence in His name. To the
            priests He has said: "Whatsoever you shall bind upon
            earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you
            shall loose upon earth shall be loosed also in heaven"
            (<i>Matt.</i> xviii. 18); and again: "Whose sins you
            shall forgive, they are forgiven, and whose sins you
            shall retain, they are retained" (<i>John</i> xx. 23).
            These two texts clearly show that auricular confession
            as practised in the Catholic Church was taught by
            Christ. For how could the apostles and their
            successors, the pastors of the Church, know what sins
            to bind and retain and what sins to loose and forgive
            unless the sins were confessed to them and they were
            allowed to judge?

            No matter how numerous or how great these are, provided
            they are confessed with a sincere repentance, they will
            be forgiven. And they will be forgiven by the power of
            the priest. Properly speaking, God alone has power to
            forgive sins. But no one will deny that He has power to
            confer this power on others. He communicated this power
            to His apostles and commanded them, in turn, to
            communicate it to others by means of the Sacrament of
            Holy Orders.
        </p>
        <p>
            That Our Saviour communicated this power to His
            apostles is evident from the words of St. John: "As the
            Father hath sent Me I also send you. Receive ye the
            Holy Ghost; whose sins you shall forgive, they are
            forgiven." But sin was to continue till the end of the
            world. Hence the necessity of the means of forgiving
            sin being coextensive with sin. As the people receive
            from the priests the Word of God and the cleansing from
            sin in Baptism, so also do they receive from them the
            cleansing from sin in confession.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is certain that the apostles conferred the power of
            forgiving sins upon others, if we find that those whom
            the apostles ordained this power. But we find this to
            be the case.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the time of Christ until the present the writers
            of every age tell us that confession of sins was
            practised. St. John, who lived until the beginning of
            the second century, says in the 1st chapter of his
            First Epistle: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful
            and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from
            all iniquity."
        </p>
        <p>
            St. Cyprian, who wrote in the third century, says: "Let
            each of you confess his faults, and the pardon imparted
            by the priest is acceptable before God."
        </p>
        <p>
            St. Ambrose, in the fourth century, wrote: "The poison
            is sin; the remedy, the accusation of one's crime. The
            poison is iniquity: confession is the remedy."
        </p>
        <p>
            St. Augustine, who lived in the fifth century, seems to
            be talking to some people of the present day, who say
            they confess in private to God, when he says: "Let no
            one say to himself, I do penance to God in private, I
            do it before God. Is it then in vain that Christ hath
            said: 'Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
            loosed in heaven'? Is it in vain that the keys have
            been given to the Church? Do we make void the Gospel?
            void the words of Christ?"
        </p>
        <p>
            These first five centuries were the golden age of
            Christianity. All admit that the doctrines and
            practices of those early centuries were pure and
            undefiled, as they came from Christ. But among the
            practices of the time we find confession. Hence it is a
            reasonable practice, because conformable to Christ's
            teaching. We might continue quotations from writers of
            every century from the sixth to the nineteenth, showing
            that the teaching and practice of confession did not
            vary through the lapse of ages from the time of Christ
            until the present day. But this is unnecessary. The
            quotations from the first five centuries show that the
            power of forgiving sin was not only communicated by
            Christ to His apostles, but by them to their successors
            by means of the sacrament of Holy Orders. What would be
            the necessity of this power if they could not exercise
            it in confession? If, as some say, priests invented
            confession, some one ought to find out and tell us when
            and where it was invented, and why they did not exempt
            themselves from such a humiliating practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Confession alone, however, will be of no avail without
            contrition. Contrition is a sincere sorrow and
            detestation for sin with a firm determination to sin no
            more. To the truly humble and sorrowful sinner
            confession is not a punishment, but a remedy for a
            tortured conscience. The most painful secret to be kept
            by a heart not yet corrupted by disease is the secret
            of sin and crime. The soul that loves God hates sin and
            desires to separate herself from it. To this desire is
            associated the desire of expiating it. All, from the
            mother who questions her child about wrongdoing to the
            judge who interrogates the criminal, recognize in
            spontaneous confession an expiatory power.
        </p>
        <p>
            Confession, it is true, is necessarily accompanied by
            shame and humiliation. This humiliation is diminished
            by the knowledge that it is of divine origin and that
            eternal silence is divinely imposed upon him who
            receives it. Priests never divulge what they know from
            the confessional. They have been ill-treated, as was
            Father Kohlmann in this country; have even been
            tortured and cruelly put to death, as was St. John
            Nepomucene, in order to extort from them knowledge they
            gained in the confessional, but without avail. For what
            they knew through the tribunal of penance, they knew as
            ministers of God. And as it is better to obey God than
            man, no minister of state could force them to divulge
            that which the laws of God forbid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only sinners, who after a thorough preparation, a
            sincere sorrow, and a good confession, can realize the
            soothing and beneficial effects of confession, and feel
            with David, "Blessed are they whose sins are forgiven."
            If you have ever noticed such after leaving the
            confessional you could see joy beaming on their
            countenances, as if a heavy burden had been removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Confession quiets the conscience. But this is only one
            of the benefits it confers upon those who practise
            going to confession. It has also a salutary influence
            upon their morals; for one of its necessary conditions
            is promise of amendment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pagans of the first centuries were aware of the
            guiding and reforming power of the confessional.
            Voltaire, the leading infidel of the last century, one
            who made sport of everything Christian, says that
            "there is, perhaps, no wiser institution, and that
            confession is an excellent thing, a restraint upon
            inveterate crime, a very good practice to prevent the
            guilty from falling into despair and relapsing into
            sin, to influence hearts full of hate to forgive and
            robbers to make restitution&mdash;that the enemies of
            the <i>Romish</i> Church who have opposed so beneficial
            an institution have taken from man the greatest
            restraint that can be put upon crime." While his
            everyday experience forced these words of praise from
            the arch-infidel, his hatred of the Church creeps out
            in the word "Romish."
        </p>
        <p>
            Confession of sin, as we have seen, is a <i>reasonable
            practice</i>, because it was taught by Jesus Christ,
            and by His apostles and their successors from Christ's
            time until the present; but <i>especially</i> because
            it has the power of soothing and pacifying the
            conscience by freeing it from the torture of sin, the
            poison of crime. It is not strange, then, that it is so
            dear to virtuous souls. It is offensive only to those
            whose hearts are so hardened as to blunt the sting of
            remorse. Confession is Christianity using its moral
            power to correct and perfect the individual. In the
            confessional the minister of God is continually coming
            in contact with hearts in which reigns an idol that he
            overthrows, a bad practice that he causes to cease, or
            some injustice that he has repaired.
        </p>
        <p>
            Confession is one of the gates by which Christianity
            penetrates the interior man, wipes away stains, heals
            diseases, and sows therein the seeds of virtue. The
            lives and experience of millions are witness of the
            truth of this. Is it not, then, a reasonable, a
            beneficial practice? It is only the malicious or the
            ignorant who calumniate the practice and the
            consecrated minister who sits in judgment in the sacred
            tribunal. Those who lay aside their prejudice and study
            the question soon become convinced of its divine
            origin. A little study and reflection will show them
            that confession of sin benefits society by preventing
            crimes that would destroy government, cause riots, and
            fill prisons; that it promotes human justice, makes men
            better, nobler, purer, higher, and more Godlike; that
            it soothes the sorrowful heart whose crime might make
            the despairing suicide; and that individuals and
            families who frequently, intelligently, and properly
            approach this fountain of God's grace will receive His
            blessing here <i>and a pledge of His union
            hereafter</i>.

            <font size="+3">O</font>F THE many practices of the
            Church, few have been the cause of more controversy
            than that of granting indulgences. Though not the
            cause, the granting of an indulgence furnished a
            pretext for Luther's apostasy. Leo X, who was Pope at
            that time, desiring to complete St. Peter's at Rome,
            appealed to all Catholics for financial aid. There was
            certainly nothing wrong in this. With these alms it was
            intended that the most magnificent Christian temple in
            the world would be completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; "Majesty, Power, Glory, Strength, and
            Beauty, all are aisled<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; In this eternal ark of worship
            undefiled."
        </p>
        <p>
            All who contributed toward the completion of St.
            Peter's and complied with the necessary conditions were
            granted an indulgence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The alms were not one of the indispensable conditions.
            Those conditions were a sincere repentance and
            confession. Hence, those who did not contribute could
            gain the indulgence. Perhaps the Dominican Tetzel, who
            was chosen to announce the indulgence, exceeded his
            powers and made them serve his own ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            His action in the affair was not approved by Rome. If
            it is certain that the Pope did nothing wrong in asking
            for aid to build that beautiful monument to religion,
            it is equally certain that he did nothing wrong, that
            he did not exceed the limits of his powers when he
            granted the indulgence. In order to understand this, we
            must have a clear idea of what is meant by an
            indulgence.
        </p>
        <p>
            You frequently hear it said that it is the forgiveness
            of sin, or that it is a permission given to commit sin.
            It is neither the one nor the other. An indulgence is
            not the forgiveness of sin. In fact, an indulgence can
            not be gained until sin has been forgiven. One of the
            necessary conditions for gaining an indulgence is
            confession.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neither is an indulgence a license, a permission to
            commit sin. No one, not even God Himself, could give
            permission to commit sin. For God is all good, and
            although all powerful He can not sanction that which is
            evil in itself. It would be contrary to His very
            nature. An indulgence, then, is not what it has been
            painted. Having seen what an indulgence is not, let us
            see what it is. It is a remission of the whole or a
            part of the debt of temporal punishment due to sin
            after the guilt and eternal punishment have been
            forgiven in the sacrament of Penance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the early ages of the Church notorious sinners,
            after being absolved, were sentenced to long public
            penances. By sincere sorrow, an indulgence or remission
            of some of the time was granted them. Public confession
            and public penances have passed away. These public
            penances are replaced by pious devotions. Upon the
            performance of certain pious devotions the Church at
            times grants an indulgence; that is, a remission of
            such temporal punishment as is equivalent to the
            canonical penances corresponding to the sins committed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Attached to every mortal sin, besides the guilt, is the
            punishment incurred. This punishment is eternal and
            temporal. That there is this twofold punishment we
            learn from various places in the Bible. We have an
            example in the sin of David. God sent the prophet
            Nathan to warn him of his guilt. When Nathan rebuked
            the king, he confessed his sin with signs of true
            contrition. Then Nathan told him that God had forgiven
            his sin, but that many temporal punishments would
            follow. When God forgave the sin, the guilt and eternal
            punishment were taken away; but temporal punishment
            remained. Other examples could be cited, but this is
            sufficient to show that there is a twofold kind of
            punishment&mdash;eternal and temporal. In confession
            the guilt and eternal punishment are taken away, but
            not always the temporal punishment. This temporal
            punishment is what is taken away in whole by a plenary
            and in part by a partial indulgence.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a similar manner we have a twofold punishment
            attached to crime in this world. A man commits a crime.
            He is sentenced to a term in the penitentiary. After
            spending his time of punishment he comes back to
            society, but finds he has another punishment to undergo
            in being avoided by his friends and others.
        </p>
        <p>
            The practice of granting indulgences was founded on
            many passages of Scripture, both of the Old and New
            Testament. In the 12th chapter of the book of Numbers
            we learn that Mary, the sister of Moses, was forgiven a
            sin which she had committed. But God inflicted upon her
            the penalty of leprosy. This was a temporal punishment.
            By the prayer of Moses an indulgence was granted; for
            God took away the temporal punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our divine Lord left with His Church the power of
            granting indulgences, as we learn from His words taken
            from St. Matthew: "Whatsoever you shall loose upon
            earth shall be loosed also in heaven." This promise
            implies the power of loosing not only from sin and its
            eternal punishment, but also the power of releasing the
            bond of temporal punishment, of freeing from everything
            that would prevent the soul from entering the kingdom
            of heaven. St. Paul granted an indulgence to the
            incestuous Corinthian, as we learn from the 2d chapter
            of his Second Epistle to the Corinthians. By the power
            and authority which he received from Christ, he granted
            the Corinthian pardon from performing a certain
            penance. This penance was a temporal punishment. The
            apostle took away the temporal punishment. That is an
            indulgence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Non-Catholics grant a kind of plenary indulgence to
            every one by saying that works of penance are
            unnecessary. The practice of the Catholic Church of
            granting an indulgence only to the deserving is
            certainly more conformable to Scripture as well as more
            reasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Experience teaches us the utility of indulgences. They
            encourage the faithful to frequent the sacraments, to
            repent, to do acts of penance, and perform works of
            piety, charity, and devotion.
        </p>
        <p>
            A practice productive of such beneficial results is
            reasonable; it is also reasonable because it is
            sanctioned by Scripture and the Church of every age.
            For God would not sanction it nor could the Church
            practise it if it were <i>not conformable to
            reason</i>.

            The historians of the first centuries tell us that the
            early Christians were as anxious to receive the last
            sacraments as are the Catholics of our own day. St.
            Cesarius, in the fifth century, writes: "As soon as a
            person falls dangerously sick, he receives the body and
            blood of Jesus Christ. Then his body is anointed, and
            thus is fulfilled what stands written: 'Is any man sick
            among you? Let him call in the priests of the Church,
            and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil.'"
            What the Christians of the first centuries did, we do;

            St. James.

            sacraments. The priest first hears the sick person's
            confession, then he administers holy communion.
            Afterward he administers the sacrament of Extreme
            Unction&mdash;last anointing.
        </p>
        <p>
            This sacrament aids the sick to bear their sufferings
            with patience. It wipes away sin, even mortal sin if
            the person is unable to confess; and it purifies the
            soul for its entrance into heaven. The other sacraments
            assist us in making our lives holy like the life of our
            divine Model. This sacrament assists in making our
            death holy, like the death of Jesus. The sacrament of
            Baptism met us at our entrance into this world; the
            sacrament of Extreme Unction will be our guide at our
            departure to the other world. Religion, which rocked us
            in the cradle of life, will lull us to sleep in the
            cradle of death.
        </p>
        <p>
            Go to the bedside of the dying Catholic and you will
            see the reasonableness of the practice of calling the
            priest to administer the last sacraments. After the
            sacraments have been administered, peace and joy and
            contentment are visible on the countenance of the sick
            person. He clings no more to the things of earth. His
            thoughts are centered in heaven. The minister of God
            consoles him with the thought of immortality and the
            resurrection of the body. He soon hears the singing of
            the angelic choir; and breathing the sweet names of
            Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, his soul takes its flight to
            the <i>regions of eternal bliss</i>.

            "It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray
            for the dead, that they may be loosed from their sins"
            (<i>2 Mach</i>. xii. 46).

            <font size="+3">N</font>O ONE will deny that the
            practice of praying for the dead is reasonable, if the
            dead are benefited by our prayers. That our prayers are
            beneficial to the departed we will endeavor to show. We
            are taught by revelation that besides heaven and hell,
            a state of everlasting pleasure and a state of eternal
            pain, there also exists a middle state of punishment
            for those who die in venial sin, or who have not
            sufficiently satisfied the justice of God for mortal
            sins already forgiven.
        </p>
        <p>
            The people of God in the Old Law believed, and Jesus
            Christ and His apostles in the New Law taught, the
            existence of this middle state. In the Second Book of
            Machabees, quoted above, we read that the pious general
            Judas Machabeus having made a collection, "sent twelve
            thousand drachmas of silver to Jerusalem for sacrifices
            to be offered for the dead [soldiers], thinking well
            and religiously concerning the resurrection [for if he
            had not hoped that they that were slain should rise
            again, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to
            pray for the dead], and because he considered that they
            who had fallen asleep with godliness had great grace
            laid up for them. It is, therefore, a holy and
            wholesome thought to pray for the dead that they may be
            loosed from their sins." If prayers were not beneficial
            to the dead, God would not have sanctioned them.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is exactly the practice of the Catholic Church. We
            pray and offer sacrifices for the souls in purgatory,
            just as Judas Machabeus did. Even if the Books of
            Machabees were not inspired, it is historically true
            that the Jews and almost all nations of antiquity
            believed in the existence of purgatory and the utility
            of prayers for the souls detained there. This universal
            consent is the voice of nature and of God. Hence we see
            that the practice of praying for the dead is
            reasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
            This practice is in accordance with the teaching of
            Christ. In the 12th chapter, 32d verse, of St. Matthew,
            He says: "He that shall speak against the Holy Ghost,
            it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor
            in the world to come."
        </p>
        <p>
            These words teach us that some sins will be pardoned in
            the life to come. They can not be pardoned in heaven,
            since nothing defiled can enter heaven; nor can they be
            pardoned in hell, out of which there is no redemption,
            for "their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not
            be quenched." Therefore, there must be a state in the
            next world where sins will be forgiven, and we call
            that place or state purgatory. And the existence of
            purgatory implies the necessity of praying for those
            detained there. The belief in the existence of
            purgatory and the practice of praying for the faithful
            departed have existed in the Church from the time of
            its foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tertullian, who lived in the second century, considered
            it a solemn duty, whose obligation came down from the
            apostles, to offer sacrifices and prayers for the
            faithful departed. St. Augustine says: "The whole
            Church received from the tradition of the Fathers to
            pray for those who died in the communion of the body
            and blood of Christ." The dying request of St. Monica,
            the mother of St. Augustine, is well known. "I request
            you," she said, "that wherever you may be, you will
            remember me at the altar of the Lord." And he assures
            us that he frequently and fervently prayed for her
            soul.
        </p>
        <p>
            The teaching of the Church of every age confirms the
            teaching of the Old and New Testament regarding
            purgatory and praying for the dead. To one who believes
            in heaven and hell, a place of eternal pleasure and of
            eternal punishment, the doctrine of purgatory must
            appear as a necessity, and the practice of praying for
            the dead reasonable. For it is certain that nothing
            defiled can enter heaven. But it is possible that many
            die guilty of but slight sins. Therefore, it must be
            said that these are damned, which is impious and
            absurd; that what is defiled can enter heaven, which is
            unscriptural; or that there is a purgatory, a state in
            which such souls are made pure as the driven snow, so
            that they can enter into the presence of their Maker.
            For an infinitely just God can not condemn to the same
            eternal punishment the child who dies guilty of a
            slight fault and the hardened murderer. No. He will
            render to every one according to his works.
        </p>
        <p>
            The doctrine of purgatory, then, is reasonable as well
            as scriptural and traditional. Reasonable, too, is the
            practice of praying for the dead, for they are still
            members of the Church. All the members of the Church,
            consisting of the church militant on earth, the church
            triumphant in heaven, and the church suffering in
            purgatory, are one family bound together by the bond of
            charity. The members of the Church on earth pray to
            those in heaven, who love us and pray for us; and we
            pray for those in purgatory. They are God's friends
            deprived of heaven for a time. As those in heaven
            rejoice when one sinner does penance, so those in
            purgatory hear us, see us, love us, and are helped by
            our prayers. We love them and never cease to pray for
            them and offer the Holy Sacrifice for them. Even the
            unbeliever will stand or kneel by the remains of his
            departed friend and offer a prayer for him, thus
            showing that praying for the dead is reasonable and the
            natural dictate of the human heart.

        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="+3">T</font>HE saints are friends of God.
            They are like the angels in heaven. We honor them, not
            as we honor God, but on account of the relation they
            bear to God. They are creatures of God, the work of His
            hands. When we honor them, we honor God; as when we
            praise a beautiful painting, we praise the artist.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not believe that the saints can help us of
            themselves. But we ask them to "pray for us." We
            believe that everything comes to us "through Our Lord
            Jesus Christ." With these words all our prayers end. It
            is useful, salutary, and reasonable to pray to the
            saints and ask them to pray for us. No doubt all will
            admit the reasonableness of this practice if the saints
            can hear and help us.
        </p>
        <p>
            That they hear and help us is evident from many
            passages of Scripture. The patriarch Jacob would not
            have prayed to the angel to bless his grandchildren
            Manasses and Ephraim (as we learn he did from
            <i>Gen</i>. xlviii.), unless he knew the angel could do
            so.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are informed (<i>Luke</i> xv.) that the angels
            rejoice when one sinner does penance. We are also
            informed (<i>Matt</i> xxii.) that the saints are like
            the angels&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, have the same happiness
            and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hence the saints, as well as the angels, can hear us,
            can help us, and are acquainted with our actions,
            words, and thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is generally conceded that it is reasonable to ask
            pious persons on earth to pray for us. St. Paul, in his
            epistles, frequently asks the Christians to pray for
            him. "Brethren," he says, "pray for us." It is well
            known that God was pleased to answer the prayer of
            Abraham in favor of Abimelech. "More things are wrought
            by prayer than this world knows of." Now, if we poor
            sinners here on earth do not pray in vain for one
            another, will the saints in heaven, the friends of God,
            who rejoice when a sinner does penance, pray in vain
            for us? No. We have hosts of friends in heaven to speak
            a good word for us. And as a child who has disobeyed
            his parents wisely asks a better brother or sister to
            intercede with his parents for mercy, so, too, having
            disobeyed our heavenly Father by sin, we have recourse
            to others better than ourselves, to our better brothers
            and sisters, the Blessed Virgin and saints, to
            intercede with God for us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Is not this a reasonable practice?
        </p>
        <p>
            If your mother or sister crosses the sea she will
            continue to pray for you. And if she crosses the sea of
            death will she forget you? No. The love she bore you
            here will continue in heaven. She will pray for you,
            and the "Lord will hear the prayers of the just." Ask
            the saints to pray to your God and their God for you.
            Honor God by honoring His friends and asking their
            intercession. And all your friends in heaven will unite
            in praying to the Father of us all that one day all who
            love God and His friends, the saints, may be admitted
            with them into the <i>company of the Saint of saints,
            Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</i>

            images were forbidden, it would be improper to have
            images or pictures of our friends.
        </p>

            It has frequently been said that Catholics ate
            idolaters, because they have in their churches
            crucifixes, relics, and images of the saints, which
            they honor. Perhaps many of those who accuse us of
            idolatry, if asked, could not tell what idolatry is.
            Idolatry is giving to a creature (whether a crucifix,
            an image, or any created thing) that honor which
            belongs to God.
        </p>
        <p>
            The honor we give those sacred things is a relative
            honor. We honor them on account of the relation they
            bear to God and His friends, the saints.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every Catholic, even the child, is taught the
            difference between the idol of the pagan and a Catholic
            image. Pagans looked upon their idols as gods. They
            thought these senseless objects had power,
            intelligence, and other attributes of the Deity. They
            worshiped them as gods and thought they could assist
            them. Hence they were image-worshipers or idolaters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Catholics know full well that images have no
            intelligence to understand, no power to assist them.
            They do not adore nor serve them. That would be
            idolatry. It would be breaking the first commandment.
            They do not say when praying before the crucifix or
            image of a saint, "I adore thee, O Crucifix"; nor "Help
            me, O Image," But they say, "I adore thee, O God, whose
            cruel death is represented by this crucifix," or "Pray
            for me, O saint represented by this image."
        </p>
        <p>
            We have images, pictures, and relics of Our Lord, His
            Blessed Mother, and the saints, for the same reason
            that we have relics and portraits of George Washington,
            Abraham Lincoln, or of our relatives and friends. They
            remind us of the original. Who can look upon the
            crucifix or upon a picture of the Crucifixion without
            being reminded of all the sufferings of Our Lord and
            Saviour Jesus Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
            And who can seriously contemplate those sufferings,
            borne for us so patiently, without being moved to pity
            and to repentance? Such a person will be moved to say
            with the heart if not with the lips: "Oh, my God, I am
            sorry for having offended Thee and caused Thee such
            suffering. Grant that I may love Thee with my whole
            heart and never more offend Thee."
        </p>
        <p>
            Catholics, as we have seen, adore God alone. They honor
            the Blessed Virgin and saints represented by images.
            They use these holy pictures and statues to beautify
            the house of God. These pictures are also a source of
            instruction. They are a profession of our faith. If you
            enter a house and see on one side of the room a picture
            of the Blessed Virgin, Cardinal Gibbons, or of Pope Leo
            XIII, and on the other a picture of Lincoln, Cleveland,
            or Washington, you will at once know the religious
            faith as well as the political belief or patriotism of
            the occupant.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the aid of the relics of the martyrs we are reminded
            of all they suffered for the faith. By the use of
            religious pictures, our devotion is increased and we
            are stimulated to imitate the virtues of the saints
            represented.
        </p>
        <p>
            If it is reasonable to have pictures of our martyred
            President and relics of our Revolutionary heroes that
            we may be reminded of their patriotism, it is none the
            less reasonable to have pictures and relics of Our
            Lord, the Blessed Virgin, and the saints, that we may
            be reminded of their virtues. By imitating their
            virtues here, we may be <i>happy with them

            The chief sacramentals that have not been mentioned are
            the books used by the priest in the performance of his
            sacred duties, the sign of the cross, holy water,
            blessed candles, blessed palm and ashes, holy oils,
            scapulars, medals, Agnus Dei, prayers, litanies,
            rosary, the Angelus, stations, the funeral service, and
            various blessings.

            The books used by the priest in the performance of his
            sacred duties are the <i>Missal</i>, which contains the
            Masses for the various feasts of the ecclesiastical
            year; the <i>Breviary</i>, in which is the office
            recited by the priest every day; and the <i>Ritual</i>,
            where is to be found the form of administering the
            different sacraments, the funeral service, and the
            various benedictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sacramental of most frequent use in the Church is
            the <i>sign of the cross</i>. It is used to remind us
            of the Passion and Death of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus
            Christ on the cross. The cross is the emblem of the
            Christian, the "sign of the Son of Man." It is an act
            of faith in the principal truths of Christianity. When
            we say the words, "In the name," we profess our faith
            in the unity of God, which means that there is but one
            God; "of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
            Ghost," are a profession of faith in the
            Trinity&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, that there are three divine
            persons in one God. The form of the cross which we
            trace with our right hand from our forehead to our
            breast, and then from the left to the right shoulder,
            is a profession of faith in the Incarnation of the Son
            of God, who became man and died on the cross for our
            redemption. Tertullian and other writers of the early
            ages of the Church tell us that before every action,
            before rising or retiring, before meals, at every step,
            "we impress on our forehead the sign of the cross." The
            Catholic Church of to-day, in accordance with the
            teachings of Christ, His apostles, and their successors
            of all time, teaches her children to put their trust in
            the merits of Jesus Christ's sufferings on the cross,
            and to do everything "in the name of the Father and of
            the Son and of the Holy Ghost."

            <i>Holy water</i> is water blessed by a priest. During
            the blessing beautiful prayers are recited. These
            prayers express the spiritual blessings the Church
            wishes to follow all who use it. The Church uses holy
            water in all the benedictions and some of her
            sacraments. It is placed at the doors of her churches,
            that all who enter may use it and be reminded of that
            purity of heart which it symbolizes. Holy water is also
            kept in the houses of Catholics, to be used in times of
            trial and when the priest comes to administer the
            sacraments.

            The <i>blessed candles</i> used in the service of the
            Church receive their special blessing on Candlemas Day.
            We use these lighted candles at different times to
            remind us of Jesus, who is the "Light of the world."
            Catholics always keep a blessed candle in the house.
            The Church puts a lighted candle in our hand at our
            baptism, and wishes us to die with one in our hand, to
            remind us to hope in Him who is our Light and the light
            of the world.
        </p>

            On Ash Wednesday <i>ashes</i> are blessed and put on
            the forehead of the faithful in the form of a cross,
            with the words, "Remember, man, that thou art dust and
            unto dust thou shalt return," to remind them that they
            are only dust and ashes. These are the ashes of burnt
            <i>palms</i> blessed the Palm Sunday of the previous
            year. These palms are blessed in memory of the
            triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, when the
            people spread palm branches along the way. This palm
            should remind us to perform faithfully our duty if we
            wish to enjoy the palm of victory.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <i>holy oils</i> are blessed by the bishop on Holy
            Thursday of each year. They are of three kinds: oil of
            the sick, used in the sacrament of Extreme Unction; oil
            of the Catechumens, used in blessing baptismal water
            and in the sacrament of Baptism; and Holy Chrism, used
            in the preparation of baptismal water in the ceremonies
            of Baptism, Confirmation, and at the consecration of a
            bishop, of churches, altars, bells and chalices. The
            olive oil used should remind us of Our Saviour's
            <i>passion</i> in the Garden of Olives.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Agnus Deis</i> (blessed by the Pope),
            <i>scapulars</i>, and <i>medals</i> are small articles
            worn by Catholics to remind them of Our Lord (the Lamb
            of God), of the Blessed Virgin, and of the saints. They
            are emblems of the Christian, as the starry banner is
            the emblem of the American; and as the flag of our
            country shows that we are under the protection of the
            Government of the United States, so the Agnus Dei,
            scapulars, and medals show that we are under the
            protection of Jesus Christ, His Blessed Mother, and His
            saints.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Prayer</i> is the elevation of our mind and heart to
            God to ask Him for all blessings, temporal and
            spiritual. Prayer is necessary to salvation. We are
            taught in St. Luke (xviii.) to pray always and faint
            not. We should pray with attention and devotion, with
            confidence and humility. We are told in the Lord's
            Prayer to pray for others as well as for ourselves, and
            God's choicest blessings will be granted us through
            Jesus Christ Our Lord. The best of all prayers is the
            one God taught us&mdash;the Lord's Prayer. Other
            prayers common in the Church are Litanies, Rosaries,
            the Angelus, Stations, and the Funeral Service for the
            dead. The Litanies most in use in the Church are the
            Litany of All Saints, of the Blessed Virgin, of the
            Holy Name of Jesus. In these Litanies we ask God to
            have mercy on us and the saints to pray for us; but we
            ask everything through Jesus Christ Our Lord. Few
            practices of the Church are more widespread than the
            <i>Rosary</i> of the Blessed Virgin. It consists of the
            best of all prayers&mdash;the Apostles' Creed, the Our
            Father, three Hail Marys, and the Glory be to the
            Father; then the Our Father and ten Hail Marys repeated
            five times. This constitutes the beads, or one-third
            part of the Rosary. During the recitation of these
            prayers the mind should be occupied meditating on the
            principal mysteries of the life of Our Lord. These
            mysteries are divided into the five joyful mysteries:
            the Annunciation by the angel Gabriel, the Visitation
            of the Blessed Virgin to St. Elizabeth, the Birth of
            Our Lord, the Presentation, and the Finding in the
            Temple; the five sorrowful mysteries: the Agony in the
            Garden, the Scourging, the Crowning with Thorns, the
            Carrying of the Cross, and the Crucifixion; and the
            five glorious mysteries: the Resurrection, the
            Ascension, the Descent of the Holy Ghost, the
            Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, and the Crowning of
            the Blessed Virgin in heaven. Any one of these
            mysteries furnishes sufficient material to occupy the
            mind of man for hours. These mysteries contain the
            whole history of the Redemption. The prayers and
            meditations of the Rosary satisfy the minds of the
            humblest, while they are sufficient to occupy the
            attention of the most exalted and most cultivated. The
            <i>Angelus</i> is a beautiful prayer, said morning,
            noon, and night. In Catholic countries the bell is
            rung, when all cease their occupations, kneel, and
            recite: "The angel of the Lord declared unto Mary, and
            she conceived by the Holy Ghost"&mdash;a Hail Mary.
            "Behold the handmaid of the Lord&mdash;be it done unto
            me according to Thy Word"&mdash;a Hail Mary. "And the
            Word was made flesh, and dwelt amongst us"&mdash;a Hail
            Mary. The prayer: "Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord,
            Thy grace into our hearts, that we, to whom the
            Incarnation of Christ, Thy Son, was made known by the
            message of an angel, may by His passion and cross be
            brought to the glory of His resurrection, through the
            same Christ Our Lord. Amen." By this beautiful practice
            we show in a special manner our faith in the
            Incarnation of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <i>Stations of the Cross</i> are fourteen paintings
            representing the various stages of the passion and
            death of Our Redeemer. The faithful pass from station
            to station and meditate upon that feature of the
            passion represented by each station. Tradition tells us
            that from the beginning pious pilgrims were accustomed
            to tread the path and bedew with their tears the way
            sanctified by our Saviour on that sorrowful journey
            from Pilate's tribunal to Calvary's heights. But
            Jerusalem falling into the hands of infidels, and many
            being unable to visit those holy places, permission was
            obtained to erect in churches fourteen crosses and
            pictures commemorating these sorrowful acts. From these
            stations all can meditate upon the sufferings of our
            Saviour, and learn from Him submission to God's holy
            will, patience, charity, and forgiveness of injuries.

        <p>
            The <i>funeral service</i> of the Catholic Church is
            beautiful, touching, and instructive. After blessing,
            strengthening, and encouraging us through life with her
            sacraments; after fortifying our souls for the last
            great struggle, she follows us beyond the grave with
            her blessings, her prayers, and her sacrifices.
            "Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord," she prays; "and
            let perpetual light shine upon them. May they rest in
            peace."
        </p>
        <p>
            There are various other prayers and blessings used by
            the Church on special occasions. In fact, the Church
            blesses everything she uses. This blessing of the
            priest is not such an absurd thing as some imagine it
            to be; it is rather a most reasonable practice. It is
            simply a prayer said by the priest, asking God to send
            His blessing upon the person or thing indicated. People
            of all denominations say grace before meals, asking God
            to bless the food they are about to use. This is
            precisely what the priest does when blessing anything.
            He uses different forms of prayer ordained by the
            Church to implore God's blessing upon the water,
            candles, and other things before using them. This
            blessing of churches, water, candles, and other things
            has its foundation on Scripture. We read in the Old
            Testament of the solemn blessing of the Temple of
            Solomon. St. Paul tells us that "every creature is
            sanctified by the word of God and prayer." Churches,
            water, candles, bells, books, persons, and other things
            blessed by the Church are creatures. Therefore we are
            following St. Paul in blessing them, for every creature
            is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not claim that those articles that are blessed
            have any efficacy in themselves; but we hope and pray
            that God in His infinite goodness and mercy may render
            those blessed articles beneficial to those using them,
            may protect them and lead them to <i>His blessed abode
            above, where all is peace and light and love.</i>

            besides the Sunday God wishes certain other days to be

            of designating these days.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the State sets aside certain national holidays in
            commemoration of its founder or of the Declaration of
            Independence, so the Church sets aside these holidays
            in honor of Jesus Christ, the Blessed Virgin, and the
            saints.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides the feasts celebrated on Sundays, there are in
            this country but six holidays of obligation. Three of
            these are commemorative of events in the life of Our
            Lord: Christmas, the Circumcision, and the Ascension;
            two, the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption, in
            honor of the Blessed Virgin; and one in honor of God's
            saints&mdash;the Feast of All Saints.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ecclesiastical year begins in Advent. Advent is a
            period of about four weeks of penance and prayer
            preparatory to the great feast of Christmas and
            corresponding to the penitential season of Lent before
            Easter. During the ecclesiastical year, the first of
            the feasts of obligation in the order of time is the
            feast of the <i>Immaculate Conception</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is celebrated on the 8th of December. On this day we
            commemorate the fact that Mary was immaculate when she
            first came into being in her mother's womb; that she
            was always pure; that sin never touched her fair soul.
            Immaculate Conception, as you will see in the article
            on the Blessed Virgin, means that she was always free
            from sin.
        </p>
        <p>
            The great feast of <i>Christmas</i>, in honor of the
            birth of Jesus Christ, is celebrated on December 25th.
            This feast is a time of joy and peace to all mankind,
            and is celebrated by the Church with much pomp and
            ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
            The festival of the <i>Circumcision</i> is kept on the
            first day of the new year. It is commemorative of Our
            Lord's strict observance of the law by submitting to
            the Jewish ceremony of circumcision. We solemnly
            celebrate the day in honor of our merciful Lord, who is
            our model in all things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next in the order of time is the feast of the
            <i>Ascension</i>. It is kept forty days after the grand
            feast of Easter, and is in honor of Our Lord's glorious
            ascension into heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <i>Assumption</i> of the Blessed Virgin, celebrated
            the 15th of August, is commemorative of the glorious
            taking up to heaven of Mary, soul and body. (This is a
            pious tradition.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>All Saints'</i> Day is November 1st. Every day is a
            saint's day. There is not a day that the Catholic
            Church does not celebrate a feast in honor of some
            special mystery or saint. But as there are more saints
            in heaven than could be thus specially honored, she
            sets aside this one day every year in honor of all the
            saints in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are various other important feasts, some of which
            fall on Sunday; but these we have mentioned being
            feasts of obligation to be observed as Sunday, it was
            thought that it would not be uninteresting to give a
            short explanation of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            On them we honor God and His special friends. Let us

            <font size="+3">W</font>HILE most Christians admit the
            necessity of Baptism for adults, the Catholic Church is
            alone in insisting upon the practice of infant Baptism.
            This practice is in accordance with the teaching of St.
            John, quoted above. It is also in accordance with
            apostolic teaching and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            We read in the 16th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles
            that St. Paul baptized Lydia "and her household," and
            that the keeper of the prison was converted and "was
            baptized and presently all his family." Among these
            families it is but reasonable to suppose that there
            were some infants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Infant Baptism was the practice of the apostles; it was
            the practice of the Christians of the early Church, as
            Origen tells us. The Church received the tradition from
            the apostles to give Baptism to infants, and it has
            been the practice of the Church from the time of Christ
            until the present.
        </p>
        <p>
            St. Paul tells us that Adam's sin was transmitted to
            all his posterity. "Wherefore as by one man sin entered
            into this world, and by sin death, and so death passed
            unto all men in whom all have sinned" (<i>Rom</i>. v.
            12). Every infant, according to St. Paul, is born to
            sin&mdash;original sin. But as Baptism takes away
            original sin, and as nothing defiled can enter heaven
            (<i>Apoc</i>. xxi.), Baptism of infants is necessary to
            open for them the gates of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
            Baptism may be validly administered by dipping,
            sprinkling, or pouring. The method practised in this
            part of Christendom is pouring the water on the head of
            the person to be baptized, saying at the same time: "I
            baptize thee in the name of the Father and of the Son
            and of the Holy Ghost."
        </p>
        <p>
            The reasonableness of the practice of baptizing infants
            will be evident if we remember that Christ taught the
            necessity of baptism for all when He said: "Unless a
            man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he can
            not enter into the kingdom of God"; and that He
            declared little children capable of entering into the
            kingdom of God when He said: "Suffer little children to
            come unto Me and forbid them not, for of such is the
            kingdom of heaven."
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, if infants are capable of entering heaven (and
            Christ so declares), they must be capable of receiving
            Baptism, without which Christ says no one can enter the
            kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
            While in adults faith and sorrow for sin are required
            before receiving Baptism, no disposition is required in
            infants.
        </p>
        <p>
            They contracted original sin without their knowledge;
            without their knowledge they are freed from it.
        </p>
        <p>
            By Baptism they are made heirs of the kingdom of
            heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
            They can be made heirs of property, of a kingdom on
            earth without their consent; why not also of the
            kingdom of heaven?
        </p>
        <p>
            Baptism is the first of the seven sacraments which the
            Church confers upon man. It cleanses us from original
            sin (actual sin also if the recipient be guilty of
            any), makes us Christians, children of God, and heirs
            of heaven. It prepares us for the reception of the
            other sacraments. By Baptism we all contracted the
            obligation of believing and practising the doctrines of
            Jesus Christ as taught us by the true Church. We fulfil
            this obligation by <i>leading a truly Christian
            life</i>.

            <font size="+3">F</font>EW practices of the Church have
            been productive of more good to society than that
            concerning Christian marriage. The Christian family is
            the foundation of Christian society, and Christian
            marriage is the basis of the Christian family. Without
            marriage neither the family nor society could exist.
            Marriage was instituted by God before society existed,
            and, as a natural consequence, it is subject not to the
            laws of society, but to the laws of God and His Church.
            The principal law and necessary condition of Christian
            marriage is its unity and indissolubility. It is the
            union of one man with one woman for the purposes
            intended by the Creator, which union is to last as long
            as both survive. Such was marriage in the beginning; to
            such it was restored by our Saviour when He made it a
            sacrament of His law and a type of His union with His
            Church.
        </p>
        <p>
            The practice of the Catholic Church in not permitting a
            divorce that will allow either party to marry during
            the life of the other, is clearly taught by Jesus
            Christ in the 5th chapter of Matthew: "He who puts away
            his wife maketh her to commit adultery, and he that
            marrieth her committeth adultery."
        </p>
        <p>
            No human power can break the bond of marriage. "What
            God hath joined together, let no man put asunder." It
            is the work of God. Let no man dare meddle with it. St.
            Paul teaches the same when he says in the 39th verse of
            the 7th chapter of the First Epistle to the
            Corinthians: "A woman is bound by the law as long as
            her husband liveth; but if her husband die, she is at
            liberty, let her marry whom she will." The practice of
            the Catholic Church is conformable to this teaching of
            Christ, St. Paul, the apostles, and their successors.
        </p>
        <p>
            In defence of this practice of forbidding divorce,
            since marriage is one and indissoluble, the Catholic
            Church has had many a severe conflict. And had she not
            fought this battle bravely for the sanctity, the unity,
            and the indissolubility of the marriage tie, Europe and
            America would today be in as degraded a condition as
            are the Mahometan and other nations where the laws of
            marriage are disregarded. For divorces are not only
            contrary to Christ's teaching concerning the sanctity,
            unity, and indissolubility of the marriage tie, but are
            also subversive of society. They sever the marriage tie
            inasmuch as the law of man can do it. If the marriage
            tie is loosened, the family is dissolved; and if the
            family is dissolved, society, the state, falls to ruin.
            Divorce destroys conjugal love, causes unhappiness,
            renders the proper education of children impossible,
            and often leads to terrible crimes. Is it not
            reasonable as well as scriptural to forbid it?
        </p>
        <p>
            The Christian husband and wife, knowing the sanctity,
            the unity, and the indissolubility of the marriage tie,
            live in love and peace and honor together; together
            they rear the issue of their union, teaching them to be
            good children, good citizens, and good Christians;
            together, after a long, a prosperous, and a happy
            union, they return to dust; and together they will meet
            again beyond the confines of the tomb&mdash;<i>yes,
            they will meet to part no more</i>.

            to carry on divine worship, to govern the Church, to
            preach His doctrine, and to administer the sacraments.

        <p>
            As in the Old Law God chose His priests from among the
            family of Aaron, so in the New Law He chooses them from
            among those whom His apostles and their successors see
            fit to ordain. Priests and other ministers of the
            Church receive in the sacrament of Holy Orders the
            power and grace to perform their sacred duties. If we
            would but consider seriously for a moment the
            importance of these duties and the great dignity of the
            minister of God, we would have no difficulty in
            understanding the reasonableness of the Catholic
            practice of showing profound respect to God's
            priesthood.
        </p>
        <p>
            The priest is the minister of Jesus Christ, who chose
            him that he might obtain for himself the greatest good
            and in return bestow this good upon his fellow-man.
            Jesus Christ chose him that he might aid Him in the
            work for which He came on earth. What a noble mission!
            What important duties! What a great dignity! To aid
            Jesus Christ in saving souls, to teach them the truths
            of salvation, to loose them from their sins, to offer
            the eucharistic sacrifice for them, to pray for them,
            to minister unto them, and to fill them with Heaven's
            choice blessings; for such a high mission, for such
            important duties did Jesus Christ choose the priest. If
            his duties are so important, his dignity must be
            correspondingly great.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the banks of the Lake of Genesareth the Great
            Teacher chose Peter as His vicar and head of His
            Church. As the pontiff could not be everywhere, Peter
            and the other apostles imposed hands on others as the
            needs of the growing Church demanded. They understood
            that it was by a living, teaching ministry this work of
            salvation was to be carried on. For we find it recorded
            in the 14th chapter of the Acts that Paul and Barnabas
            ordained priests in Lystra and Iconium.
        </p>
        <p>
            Paul also consecrated Titus Bishop of Crete, for the
            express purpose of ordaining others. Thus we see that
            as Christ was sent by the Father, the apostles by
            Christ, so, too, is the priest invested with the same
            power "for the perfecting of the saints, for the work
            of the ministry and for the edification of the body of
            Christ" (<i>Eph</i>. iv. 12), and that no one but a
            priest divinely called, rightly ordained, and
            legitimately sent has power from God to teach God's
            words to the faithful. He is the ambassador of God,
            commissioned to do His work with His authority; the
            vicar of Christ continuing the work He commenced; and
            the organ of the Holy Ghost for the sanctification of
            souls. He is ever imitating his model, going "about
            doing good." He devotes his life to alleviate the
            sufferings of men. To spend one's life instructing man
            is but second in importance to alleviating his
            sufferings. This the priest is ever doing. He rescued
            us from barbarism; saved for us at the risk of his life
            the Holy Scriptures, the classics of Greece and Rome,
            and the writings of the Fathers; founded the great
            universities of Europe; and is to-day, as in the past,
            the greatest educator in the world. He does all this
            for love of God. Do you wonder, then, that Catholics
            love and revere their priests?

            matrimony as a holy state. She recommends celibacy to
            those desiring greater perfection, and enjoins it on
            her priests because, as St. Paul says, "He who is
            unmarried careth about the things of the Lord." It is
            said that the life of the priest is a hard, lonely one,
            and that it is unscriptural. Let us see. That his life
            is one of hardships is certain. His path is by no means
            one of roses; it is rather one covered with thorns. The
            young man knows this well before he enters it. With a
            full knowledge of its duties and responsibilities, he
            willingly enters the priesthood. He knows well that it
            is a life full of trials and crosses. He knows, too,
            that the whole life of Jesus Christ, from the stable of
            Bethlehem to the cross on Calvary's heights, was one
            continuous trial, cross, mortification; and that the
            life of every follower, especially every minister, of
            Jesus Christ should be fashioned after that of his
            divine model. "If any man will come after Me," He says
            in the 16th chapter of St. Matthew, "let him deny
            himself, take up his cross and follow Me." The
            disciple, the minister of Christ, is not above his
            Master; and it is not becoming that the path of the
            disciple or minister should be covered with flowers
            while that of the Master was strewn with thorns and
            sprinkled with His own precious blood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, the priest's life is one of trials, crosses, and
            hardships. But the more trials he has to bear, the more
            crosses he has to carry, the more hardships he has to
            endure, the greater is his resemblance to his model,
            Jesus Christ; and if he bears those trials, crosses,
            and hardships, which he shares with his Master here,
            with a proper spirit, the more certain he is of sharing
            with Him a happy eternity hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
            But is the life of celibacy unscriptural? No. In fact,
            few questions are more clearly defined in Holy
            Scripture than that of religious celibacy. St. Paul, in
            the 7th chapter of the First Epistle to the
            Corinthians, says: "I would have you without
            solicitude. He who is unmarried careth for the things
            of the Lord, how he may please God; but he who is
            married careth about the things of the world, how he
            may please his wife, and is divided. And the unmarried
            woman and virgin thinketh about the things of the Lord,
            how she may be holy in body and spirit. But she that is
            married thinketh about the things of the world, how she
            may please her husband. Therefore," he concludes, "he
            that giveth his virgin in marriage doth well; and he
            who giveth her not doth better." Could language be
            clearer? Marriage is good; celibacy is better.
        </p>
        <p>
            "He that is unmarried careth about the things of the
            Lord, how he may please God." This teaching of St. Paul
            is the teaching of the Church&mdash; that marriage is
            honorable, is good, but that there is a better, a
            holier state for those who are called by the grace of
            God to embrace it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Religious celibacy is one of the principal reasons why
            the Catholic priest and missionary will risk all
            dangers, overcome all obstacles, face all terrors, and
            in time of plague expose himself to death in its most
            disgusting forms for the good of his fellow-man.
        </p>
        <p>
            All are acquainted with the noble examples of numbers
            of priests and Sisters of Charity who, at the risk of
            their own lives, voluntarily nursed the sick and dying
            during the yellow-fever scourge in the South a few
            years ago. Do you think they would have done so had
            they families depending upon them? No; they would have
            cared for the things of this world. Jesus Christ has
            said: "Greater love than this no man hath, that a man
            give up his life for his fellow-man." This the good
            priest is ever doing, ever ready to do. Although death
            stares him in the face, he never shrinks from his post
            of duty, never abandons his flock while there is a
            wound to heal, a soul to save.
        </p>
        <p>
            When his duty calls him, he is not afraid of death,
            because St. Paul says: "<i>He who is without a wife is
            solicitous about the things of the Lord.</i>"

            precious blood. If it is important, He must have taught

            "keep the commandments."
        </p>
        <p>
            To assist us in keeping the commandments He left a

            gave the apostles and their successors power to do what
            He had just done: "Do this in commemoration of Me." He
            also gave them power to baptize, to forgive sins, to
            bless, to be "dispensers of the mysteries of God." He
            gave them power to confer these powers on others. "As

            also send you." To these apostles and their successors
            He spoke when He said that He would remain with them
            until the consummation of the world. To them and the
            Church He said: "He that hears you hears Me." What the
            Church teaches, then, Christ teaches.

            As, in the natural order, man is born, grows to
            manhood, is nourished, and if sick needs proper food
            and remedies: so, in the supernatural order, there is a
            birth, it is Baptism; there is a manly growth, it is
            Confirmation; there is a nourishing food, it is the
            Holy Eucharist, the Bread of Life; there is a medicinal
            remedy against death, it is Penance; and there is a
            balm to heal the wounds, the scars of sin, it is
            Extreme Unction. These are some of the channels through
            which God's grace flows into our souls to assist us to
            keep the commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The practices of the Church naturally flow from her
            teachings. She teaches that there is but one God, the
            creator and Lord of heaven and earth and all things;
            that man by his reason alone can find out this truth;
            that the order, beauty, and harmony of the works of
            nature show God's work; but that there are some truths
            which the deepest intellect of man can never fathom.
            Hence she teaches that God has revealed certain truths;
            such as the mysteries of the Holy Trinity, the
            Incarnation, and the Blessed Sacrament. When we know
            that God has revealed these truths we are acting
            reasonably not only in believing them, but also in
            showing our belief by practices of respect, adoration,
            and love.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Church teaches that we must not only believe, but
            practise our religion. For faith alone will not save
            us. "Faith without works is dead." To have these works
            we must "keep the commandments." We must love God above
            all things and our neighbor as ourselves. All the
            commandments are comprised in this. In fact, the
            essence of Christianity is charity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where will you find charity practised in reality except
            in the Catholic Church? If you wish to see the truth of
            this, visit our larger towns and cities, and you will
            find hundreds of hospitals, asylums, schools, and other
            charitable institutions in which are thousands of the
            children of the Catholic Church, who have left
            everything to alleviate every ill that flesh is heir
            to, and follow the meek and humble Jesus in His mission
            of love.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Catholic Church alone teaches, as Jesus taught
            while on earth, the duty of penance. "If any man will
            come after Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross
            and follow Me." According to Christ's teaching, the
            Church sets aside the penitential season of Lent and
            other times of mortification.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Church also teaches that we must not only be
            faithful in the observance of the practices of
            religion, but that we must also live in peace and
            justice and charity with all mankind, and die with a
            hope beyond the grave. If we love God we will
            faithfully observe the practices of the Church; these
            practices will assist us in keeping the commandments,
            by which we will enter into life.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have seen that the various ceremonies and practices
            of the Catholic Church are dictated by right reason;
            that they are the rational deduction from Christ's
            teaching; that they obtain for us divine grace, excite
            pious thoughts, and elevate our minds to God; and that
            a true Christian is one who not only believes but also
            practises the teachings of Christ and His Church. The
            observance of these pious practices of the Church makes
            us Christians in fact as well as in name. They assist
            us to keep the commandment and to live in accordance
            with our faith. By faithfully observing them, we show
            that we are not ashamed to be Christ's followers. And
            if we follow Him, who is the way, the truth, and the
            life, we will not walk in darkness; but will enter by
            the narrow way into the presence of truth itself, <i>in
            the regions of eternal light</i>.
